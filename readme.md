These are apps I put together to learn Javascript some years ago!  The code isn't the sort of thing anyone would want to use, but still better on github than some random host.

- http://mengtzu.github.io/exalted is an Exalted 2.5 edition interactive tutorial.  This is significantly less useful now that Exalted 3rd Edition exists, but people noticed when it went down so it still has a role in the older edition's long tail I guess :)

- http://mengtzu.github.io/touhou is Puppeteer of Hearts, a matchmaking fangame for Touhou Project.  I made it after attending the Reitaisai event and seeing the titanic number of people invested in shipping these characters; I thought it might be fun to take a Championship Manager style approach to that idea.
